#### what you built and what you didn't build

The application status page was built, where it is possible to have the same view passed by the CLI, available in an organization that makes sense and where I based myself on players such as aws, digital ocean and netlify.

With the time left, I created a helper to facilitate the use of SVG in the application, it was something I had already created before and I think it's very useful for day-to-day use. 

#### what you'd improve or fix if you had more time

I would also like to focus on the responsiveness of the status page, formatting the dates for a better presentation. 

If I had more time, I could have thought of a solution that uses GraphQL Realtime

I like the idea of being able to see multiple deploys in a listing and with that identify which ones ran successfully and which ones failed and when it happened 

#### how you'd determine if this feature is successful

I think the functionality was successfully delivered after doing some testing and being able to actually see the statuses on the pages, knowing that instances are running and that it's being updated every x time.
